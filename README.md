# bank-loan-analysis
The bank loan analysis project focused on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as year-wise loan amount distribution, grade and sub-grade-wise revolving balances, and total payments for verified versus non-verified accounts. It also examined loan status by state and last credit pull date, along with a comparison of homeownership status and last payment dates. The analysis provided insights into lending trends, risk assessment, repayment behaviors, and regional differences in loan performance. 
1. Year-wise Loan Amount Stats: Analyze the total loan amounts distributed each year to observe trends in lending. This could highlight periods of high or low loan disbursement, reflecting changes in market demand or the bank's lending policies.

2. Grade and Sub-grade-wise Revolving Balance (revol_bal): Examine the distribution of revolving balances (outstanding credit card balances) across different loan grades and sub-grades. This can help assess risk levels associated with various loan grades and the credit behavior of borrowers.

3. Total Payment for Verified Status vs. Non-Verified Status: Compare the total payments made by customers with verified financial status versus those without verification. This can give insights into whether verifying financial status impacts repayment behavior.

4. State-wise and Last Credit Pull Date-wise Loan Status: Track loan status (e.g., current, late, charged off) by state and the most recent date a credit check was performed (last_credit_pull_d). This helps to understand regional differences in loan performance and the relevance of updated credit pulls in maintaining healthy loan portfolios.

5. Home Ownership vs. Last Payment Date Stats: Investigate how homeownership status correlates with the timing of last payments. This could reveal insights into whether homeowners tend to be more prompt or delayed in their payments compared to non-homeowners.
